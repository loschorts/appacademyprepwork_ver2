Each of us a geode looking to be cracked open
At a consistent distance
The conveyor belt
I drink water now
I am no longer young except to those who are older
In the way that youth moves along
I try to be gentle
Over and over
The years crack you open enough
With aloe juice and cayenne
That was how being young tasted
And to crack each other open
The planets we strained to reach
The plagues we wished upon ourselves
